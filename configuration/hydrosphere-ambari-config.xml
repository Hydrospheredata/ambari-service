        <description>This is used to setup the Ambari view for Mist. Set this to the public
            host/IP of Mist node (which must must be reachable from your local machine). If
            installing on sandbox (or local VM), change this to the IP address of VM.
            If installing on cloud, set this to public name/IP of zeppelin node. Alternatively, if
            you already have a local hosts file entry for the internal hostname of the zeppelin node
            (e.g. sandbox.hortonworks.com), you can leave this empty - it will default to internal
            hostname
